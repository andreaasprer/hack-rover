The issue turned out to be that my fastener and the motor holes were not concentric because the measurement of the holes were slightly off, but not visible enough to tell they were unaligned.',
                    'When taking the measurements for the holes, I used SolidWorks measuring tool. Thanks to this issue though, I learned that you can edit parts and even create sketches and convert entities on assembly which was very useful for day 2 when creating parts that needed a mold fit to other pieces.',
                    'Another conflict I ran into was grabbing parts from GrabCAD. I was conflicted between choosing a part with a motor that was more accurate to my actual motor dimensions vs a part that included both a motor and a wheel. However after consulting with my teammates I decided to choose the CAD that was more accurate.'

That wedge has a hole (extrude cut) so the motor can fit in, but the dimensions were too accurate to the motor that the motor could not fit in.',

Specifically one part that really required a joint collaboration between me and Chen was the arm. The motor was connected to a servo horn which was too small to have any arm component to be connected. Luckily our team was able to solve this problem by creating a CAD part that had an extrude cut that fit the servo horn'
